## Overview of Issues

Your current system uses a shared database where `users`, `products`, `carts`, and other tables live together. While functional, this creates tight coupling that prevents independent scaling, deployment, and ownership.

Based on code analysis, these **critical architectural issues** must be addressed:

| Issue | Risk | Why It Matters |
|------|------|----------------|
| **Product Service**: FK between Product ‚Üí Category | Tight coupling | One service cannot evolve without breaking another |
| **Cart Service**: Cascading FKs to users, products | No autonomy | Changes in Auth or Product affect Cart logic |
| **Inter-Service Communication**: Direct DB joins | Violates bounded contexts | Services become dependent on internal schemas |
| **Authentication**: Gateway injects `X-User-ID` | Security vulnerability | Downstream services trust unverified headers |
| **Data Model**: Storing only `category_name` | Update chaos | Renaming categories requires full table updates |
| **No Re-validation**: JWT not checked downstream | Broken zero-trust model | Compromised gateway can spoof any user |
| **Migration**: Direct schema changes | Downtime/data loss | High-risk deployments with no rollback plan |

We‚Äôll fix them one by one ‚Äî preserving what worked, enhancing what was risky, and adding missing resilience patterns.

---

## Fix 1: Remove Foreign Key Constraints in Product Service

### ‚ùå Problem: Shared Database Coupling

Currently, the `Product` model enforces a foreign key to `Category.id`. This means:
- The Product Service depends on the Category table‚Äôs existence and structure
- Schema changes in categories break product service
- You cannot deploy or scale independently

Additionally, storing only `category_name` in the product table leads to **massive update overhead** when renaming categories ‚Äî potentially affecting millions of rows.

### ‚úÖ Corrected Solution: Reference ID + Denormalized Name

Instead of enforcing referential integrity at the database level, we shift to **logical references** using IDs and **safe denormalization** for performance.

This balances speed and maintainability.

#### Step 1: Update Product Model  
File: `backend/product_service/app/models/product.py`

```python
# Before:
category_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('categories.id'))
category = relationship("Category", back_populates="products")

# After (CORRECTED):
category_id = Column(Integer, nullable=True)           # Logical reference only ‚Äì no DB enforcement
category_name = Column(String(100), nullable=False)    # For fast display; denormalized copy
```

> üîÑ Why This Works:
> - `category_id` allows filtering/querying by category
> - `category_name` avoids JOINs during reads
> - No foreign key ‚Üí no deployment blocking
> - Can sync name changes asynchronously (see [Handling Data Consistency](#handling-data-consistency--denormalization))

#### Step 2: Update CRUD Logic
When creating or updating a product, always set both fields.

File: `backend/product_service/app/services/product_service.py`

```python
def create_product(product_data, category):
    """
    Creates a product with both category ID and name.
    Ensures fast reads and consistent filtering.
    """
    product_data['category_id'] = category.id
    product_data['category_name'] = category.name  # Copy once at creation time
    
    product = Product(**product_data)
    db.add(product)
    db.commit()
    return product
```

‚úÖ Benefits:
- Fast queries: `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category_id = 5`
- No JOIN needed for UI: already has `category_name`
- Independent evolution: Category service can change without breaking Product

üö´ Removed: `FOREIGN KEY (category_id)` constraint

> üí° Real-world analogy: Amazon doesn‚Äôt JOIN orders with products ‚Äî it stores product name/price at purchase time. Same principle applies here.

---

## Fix 2: Remove Foreign Key Constraints in Cart Service

### ‚ùå Problem: Cascading Deletes Across Services

The Cart Service currently uses cascading foreign keys like:
```python
user_id = Column(String(255), ForeignKey("users.uid", ondelete="CASCADE"))
```

This tightly couples Cart to Auth, violating microservice boundaries.

If the `users` table changes, the entire cart system may break.

### ‚úÖ Solution: Store IDs Only ‚Äì No Foreign Keys

Remove **only the foreign key constraints**, not the ID columns. This keeps functionality while achieving independence.

#### Step 1: Modify Cart Model  
File: `backend/cart_service/app/models/cart.py`

```python
# Before:
user_id = Column(String(255), ForeignKey("users.uid", ondelete="CASCADE"), nullable=False, unique=True)
user = relationship("User", back_populates="carts")

# After:
user_id = Column(String(255), nullable=False, unique=True)
# Relationship removed ‚Äì no ORM-level coupling
```

#### Step 2: Modify CartItem Model

```python
# Before:
cart_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("carts.id", ondelete="CASCADE"), nullable=False)
cart = relationship("Cart", back_populates="items")

# After:
cart_id = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
# No relationship ‚Äì just store the ID
```

Repeat for:
- `Wishlist.user_id`
- `WishlistItem.wishlist_id`
- `CartPromoCode.cart_id`, `promo_code_id`

‚úÖ Result:
- Services remain autonomous
- Can query by `user_id`, `product_id`, etc., without DB-level dependency
- No risk of cascading deletes across service boundaries

üö´ Removed: All `FOREIGN KEY (...) REFERENCES ... ON DELETE CASCADE` constraints

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Never allow one service to delete another service‚Äôs data directly.

---

## Fix 3: Implement Service-to-Service Communication

### ‚ùå Problem: Direct DB Access vs. API Calls

Currently, services access each other‚Äôs data via direct database queries. But in microservices, **no service should read/write another‚Äôs database**.

Instead, use **APIs** to request data.

### ‚úÖ Solution: HTTP Clients with Caching & Error Handling

Replace JOINs with secure, observable API calls.

#### Step 1: Update Product Service Client  
File: `backend/cart_service/app/services/product_service.py`

```python
"""
Product Service Client Module

Handles communication with the Product microservice.
Implements caching and retry logic for resilience.
"""

import aiohttp
from fastapi import HTTPException
import logging
from app.core.config import settings

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class ProductService:
    """Client for interacting with the Product Service."""
    
    @staticmethod
    async def get_product(product_id: int):
        """Fetch product details from Product Service.
        
        Uses Redis cache to reduce load and improve latency.
        Retries on transient failures.
        """
        # Try cache first
        cache_key = f"product_{product_id}"
        cached = await get_from_cache(cache_key)
        if cached:
            return ProductResponse(**cached)

        # Call remote service
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            try:
                url = f"{settings.PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL}/api/products/{product_id}"
                async with session.get(url) as response:
                    if response.status == 200:
                        data = await response.json()
                        # Cache for 5 minutes
                        await set_in_cache(cache_key, data, expire=300)
                        return ProductResponse(**data)
                    elif response.status == 404:
                        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Product not found")
                    else:
                        raise HTTPException(status_code=response.status, detail="Service error")
            except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
                logger.error(f"Failed to connect to Product Service: {e}")
                raise HTTPException(status_code=503, detail="Product Service unavailable")
```

#### Step 2: Implement User Service Client
Create: `backend/cart_service/app/services/user_service.py`

```python
"""
User Service Client Module

Critical for validating user context before cart operations.
"""

import aiohttp
from fastapi import HTTPException

from app.core.config import settings

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class UserService:
    """Client for interacting with the Auth Service."""
    
    @staticmethod
    async def get_user(user_id: str):
        """Fetch user by ID.
        
        Validates that user exists and is active.
        Used during cart modification and checkout.
        """
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            try:
                url = f"{settings.USER_SERVICE_URL}/auth/users/{user_id}"
                async with session.get(url) as response:
                    if response.status == 200:
                        return await response.json()
                    elif response.status == 404:
                        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")
                    else:
                        raise HTTPException(status_code=response.status, detail="Auth service error")
            except aiohttp.ClientError as e:
                logger.error(f"Failed to connect to Auth Service: {e}")
                raise HTTPException(status_code=503, detail="Auth Service unavailable")
```

#### Step 3: Update Cart Operations to Use Service Calls
File: `backend/cart_service/app/services/cart_service.py`

```python
async def add_item_to_cart(cart_id, product_id, quantity, user_id):
    """
    Adds an item to the cart after validating user and product.
    
    Ensures data integrity even without shared database.
    """
    # Validate user exists
    try:
        user = await UserService.get_user(user_id)
    except HTTPException:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid or inactive user")

    # Validate product exists
    try:
        product = await ProductService.get_product(product_id)
    except HTTPException:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid product")

    # Proceed with business logic
    cart_item = CartItem(
        cart_id=cart_id,
        product_id=product_id,
        quantity=quantity
    )
    db.add(cart_item)
    db.commit()
    return cart_item
```

> üîÅ This replaces JOINs with verified API calls ‚Äî safer and more scalable.

---

## Fix 4: Enhance API Gateway Authentication

### ‚ùå Critical Flaw: Trusting Injected Headers

Original design had the Gateway inject:
```http
X-User-ID: abc123
```
And downstream services trusted it blindly.

This is a **privilege escalation vulnerability** ‚Äî attackers could spoof admin access.

### ‚úÖ Secure Identity Propagation: Zero-Trust Model

Never trust ‚Äî always verify.

#### Step 1: Gateway Validates JWT Only
File: `backend/gateway/app/middleware/auth.py`

```python
"""
Authentication Middleware for API Gateway

Validates JWT tokens but does NOT inject user context.
Preserves security by forwarding original token.
"""

import jwt
from fastapi import Request, HTTPException
from app.core.config import settings

async def validate_jwt_token(request: Request):
    """Validate JWT from Authorization header.
    
    Returns payload only for logging ‚Äî never trusts it for authorization.
    """
    auth_header = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not auth_header:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Missing Authorization header")

    try:
        token = auth_header.split(" ")[1]
        payload = jwt.decode(token, settings.JWT_SECRET_KEY, algorithms=["HS256"])
        return payload
    except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Token expired")
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid token")
```

#### Step 2: Forward Original Token ‚Äì No Header Injection

In proxy logic (`backend/gateway/app/routing.py`):

```python
# DO NOT ADD:
# headers["X-User-ID"] = ...
# headers["X-User-Role"] = ...

# Instead, forward original:
forwarded_headers = {
    "Authorization": request.headers.get("Authorization"),
    "Content-Type": content_type,
    "X-Request-ID": generate_request_id()  # For tracing
}
```

#### Step 3: Downstream Services Re-Validate JWT

File: `backend/cart_service/app/core/security.py`

```python
"""
Security utilities for Cart Service

Re-validates JWT token received from Gateway.
Follows zero-trust principle: every service verifies identity.
"""

from fastapi import Request, HTTPException
from app.core.config import settings
import jwt

def get_current_user(request: Request):
    auth = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not auth or "Bearer " not in auth:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Not authenticated")

    token = auth.split(" ")[1]
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token, settings.JWT_SECRET_KEY, algorithms=["HS256"])
        return {
            "uid": payload["sub"],
            "role": payload.get("role", "customer")
        }
    except jwt.PyJWTError:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid or expired token")
```

üîê This ensures:
- Even if Gateway is compromised, services still verify
- Full audit trail per service
- Compliance with security best practices

## Handling Data Consistency & Denormalization

Without shared databases, how do we keep data consistent?

Answer: **Eventual consistency with background sync**.

### ## Category Name Synchronization

When a category is renamed (e.g., "Electronics" ‚Üí "Smart Devices"), existing products should reflect the change.

#### ‚úÖ Event-Driven Sync Strategy

##### Step 1: Publish Event When Category Updated
File: `product_service/app/services/category_service.py`

```python
import redis
import json
from datetime import datetime

redis_client = redis.from_url(settings.REDIS_URL)

def publish_category_updated(category_id: int, new_name: str):
    """Publish event when category name changes."""
    message = {
        "event": "CategoryUpdated",
        "category_id": category_id,
        "new_name": new_name,
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    }
    redis_client.publish("category_events", json.dumps(message))
```

##### Step 2: Background Worker Updates Products
File: `workers/category_sync_worker.py`

```python
"""
Background worker that listens for category updates
and synchronizes denormalized names in products table.
"""

import json
import redis
from app.models.product import Product
from app.database import SessionLocal

def handle_category_updated(event_data):
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        category_id = event_data["category_id"]
        new_name = event_data["new_name"]

        result = db.query(Product)\
            .filter(Product.category_id == category_id)\
            .update({"category_name": new_name})
        
        db.commit()
        print(f"Synced {result} products for category {category_id}")
    except Exception as e:
        db.rollback()
        print(f"Error syncing category: {e}")
    finally:
        db.close()

# Listen loop
redis_client = redis.from_url(settings.REDIS_URL)
pubsub = redis_client.pubsub()
pubsub.subscribe("category_events")

for message in pubsub.listen():
    if message['type'] == 'message':
        data = json.loads(message['data'])
        if data['event'] == 'CategoryUpdated':
            handle_category_updated(data)
```

Run worker separately:
```bash
python workers/category_sync_worker.py
```

##### Step 3: Graceful Degradation
- Retry failed updates with exponential backoff
- Alert on persistent failures
- Accept **eventual consistency** ‚Äî data may be briefly stale

> üí° Real-world example: Amazon shows old product names briefly after edit ‚Äî then syncs globally.

---

## Service-to-Service Security

Internal APIs must be protected ‚Äî not open to any caller.

### ## Internal Service Authentication

Two secure options:

### Option 1: Shared JWT Secret (Simple, Good for MVP)

All services use same secret to verify tokens.

Add to `.env`:
```env
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_long_secure_secret_here
```

Load in each service:
```python
SECRET_KEY = settings.JWT_SECRET_KEY
```

‚úÖ Pros: Simple  
‚ùå Cons: One breach compromises all

Use for small teams or early-stage apps.

---

### Option 2: Service Tokens (Secure, Enterprise-Grade)

Each service has its own identity.

#### Example: Cart Service Calls Product Service

1. Get service token:
   ```json
   {
     "iss": "cart-service",
     "aud": "product-service",
     "exp": 1234567890
   }
   ```

2. Include in request:
   ```http
   Authorization: Bearer <service-token>
   ```

3. Product Service validates issuer and audience.

üîß Tools: Use HashiCorp Vault or Firebase Custom Tokens.

‚úÖ Pros:
- Prevents rogue service access
- Enables audit logs per service
- Limits blast radius

Use for high-scale or regulated systems.

---

## Testing and Validation

### Unit Test: JWT Re-Validation in Cart Service

File: `backend/cart_service/tests/test_security.py`

```python
from app.core.security import get_current_user
from fastapi import Request
from unittest.mock import Mock

def test_jwt_validation_rejects_missing_token():
    request = Mock(headers={})
    with pytest.raises(HTTPException) as exc:
        get_current_user(request)
    assert exc.value.status_code == 401

def test_jwt_validation_accepts_valid_token(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setattr("jwt.decode", lambda t, k, a: {"sub": "user123"})
    request = Mock(headers={"Authorization": "Bearer fake.token.here"})
    user = get_current_user(request)
    assert user["uid"] == "user123"
```

### Integration Test: Handle Service Outage

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
@patch('app.services.product_service.httpx.AsyncClient.get')
async def test_get_product_when_down(mock_get):
    mock_get.side_effect = ConnectError("Connection refused")
    with pytest.raises(HTTPException) as exc:
        await ProductService.get_product(1)
    assert exc.value.status_code == 503
```

### Load Test Inter-Service Latency

```python
# locustfile.py
from locust import HttpUser, task

class CartUser(HttpUser):
    @task
    def view_cart_with_products(self):
        self.client.get("/api/cart")
        for pid in [1, 2, 3]:
            self.client.get(f"/api/products/{pid}")
```

Run:
```bash
locust -f locustfile.py --host=http://localhost:8003
```

---

## Deployment Considerations ‚Äì With Safe Migration & Rollback

Never run destructive changes on live databases.

### ‚úÖ Phased Migration Plan

#### Phase 1: Add New Columns (Safe)
```sql
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN category_name VARCHAR(100);
UPDATE products SET category_name = 'Unknown' WHERE category_name IS NULL;
```

No downtime.

#### Phase 2: Backfill Gradually
```python
async def backfill_category_names():
    batch = db.query(Product).filter(Product.category_name.is_(None)).limit(1000)
    for p in batch:
        category = await ProductService.get_category(p.category_id)
        p.category_name = category.name
        db.commit()
```

Run nightly until complete.

#### Phase 3: Switch Application Logic
Deploy new version that reads `category_name`.

#### Phase 4: Remove Old Constraints
Only after success:
```sql
ALTER TABLE products DROP CONSTRAINT products_category_id_fkey;
```

---

### #### Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:

1. **Re-deploy previous version**
2. It still uses old logic/columns ‚Äî works fine
3. New columns remain unused ‚Äî harmless
4. No data loss
5. Fix issue and retry

Optional: Use feature flag:
```python
USE_NEW_MODEL = os.getenv("USE_NEW_MODEL", "false") == "true"
```

Allows instant rollback via config.
