# Microservice Architecture Implementation Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to implement the microservice architecture improvements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Model Updates

#### Product Service
- **File**: `backend/product_service/app/models/product.py`
  - Removed `ForeignKey('categories.id')` constraint from `category_id`
  - Removed `category` relationship
  - Added `category_name` field for denormalization

- **File**: `backend/product_service/app/models/category.py`
  - Removed `products` relationship

#### Cart Service
- **File**: `backend/cart_service/app/models/cart.py`
  - Removed all ForeignKey constraints:
    - `user_id` ForeignKey to users
    - `cart_id` ForeignKey to carts
    - `wishlist_id` ForeignKey to wishlists
    - `cart_id` and `promo_code_id` ForeignKeys in CartPromoCode
  - Removed all relationships between models

- **File**: `backend/cart_service/app/models/user.py`
  - **Deleted** - User data now comes from Auth Service

### 2. Service Configuration Updates

#### Product Service
- **File**: `backend/product_service/app/core/config.py`
  - Added `cart_service_url` setting for service communication

#### Cart Service
- Configuration already had JWT settings

### 3. New Utility Modules

#### Circuit Breaker
- **File**: `backend/cart_service/app/utils/circuit_breaker.py`
  - Implements circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascade failures
  - Configurable failure thresholds and recovery timeouts

#### Rate Limiter
- **File**: `backend/cart_service/app/middleware/rate_limiter.py`
  - Implements rate limiting for internal endpoints
  - In-memory storage (Redis recommended for production)

### 4. Service Communication Improvements

#### Product Service Client
- **File**: `backend/cart_service/app/services/product_service.py`
  - Enhanced with caching (TTLCache)
  - Integrated with circuit breaker
  - Added cache invalidation functions

#### Event Publisher
- **File**: `backend/product_service/app/services/event_publisher.py`
  - Publishes events to other services
  - Handles service notifications with error handling

#### Event Processor
- **File**: `backend/cart_service/app/services/event_processor.py`
  - Processes events with retry logic
  - Implements dead letter queue for failed events

### 5. Route Updates

#### Internal Routes
- **File**: `backend/cart_service/app/routes/internal.py`
  - Added event handling endpoint
  - Added health check endpoint

#### Main Application
- **File**: `backend/cart_service/app/main.py`
  - Updated to include internal routes
  - Removed reference to deleted user model

### 6. Service Logic Updates

#### Product Service
- **File**: `backend/product_service/app/services/product_service.py`
  - Removed all `selectinload` calls
  - Simplified database queries

#### Category Service
- **File**: `backend/product_service/app/services/category_service.py`
  - Added event publishing on category updates

### 7. Database Migration
- **File**: `database/migrations/remove_foreign_keys.sql`
  - SQL script to remove foreign key constraints
  - Adds denormalized fields
  - Preserves existing data

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Decoupling
- Removed all foreign key constraints between services
- Added denormalized fields to maintain data availability
- Preserved existing data during migration

### 2. Secure Authentication
- JWT validation in route handlers
- FastAPI dependency injection for authentication
- Proper error handling for invalid tokens

### 3. Reliable Communication
- Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascade failures
- Caching reduces service load
- Health checks monitor service status

### 4. Data Consistency
- Event-driven architecture for data synchronization
- Retry logic for failed event processing
- Dead letter queue for unprocessable events

### 5. Operational Excellence
- Rate limiting protects internal endpoints
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting

## Testing Verification

All changes have been verified to:
1. Compile without syntax errors
2. Maintain existing API compatibility
3. Remove database coupling between services
4. Implement proper authentication
5. Provide reliable service communication
