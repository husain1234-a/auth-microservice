You're asking about a great architectural question! In industry-standard microservice applications, there are typically two common approaches to authentication and authorization:
Approach 1: Gateway-Level Authentication (More Common)
API Gateway performs initial authentication validation
Gateway forwards user info (user ID, roles, etc.) to downstream services via headers
Individual services trust the gateway and use the forwarded user info
Services may still call auth service for role-specific checks
Approach 2: Service-Level Authentication (Higher Security)
API Gateway performs initial authentication validation
Gateway forwards the original token to downstream services
Each service independently calls auth service to verify the token
Services make authorization decisions based on verified user info
Industry Best Practices
Most production systems use a hybrid approach:
API Gateway does:
Initial token validation (signature, expiration)
Extracts user identity and basic claims
Attaches user context to headers (user ID, roles, etc.)
Services do:
Trust gateway for basic authentication
Validate user roles/permissions for sensitive operations
Call auth service only when needed for detailed user info or role checks
Why This Hybrid Approach?
Performance: Avoids redundant token verification at each service
Security: Services still verify authorization for sensitive operations
Scalability: Reduces load on auth service
Reliability: Gateway acts as a security perimeter
In your current implementation, you're implementing Approach 2 where services directly call the auth service. This is more secure but can create additional load on your auth service. For production, you might consider optimizing this with the hybrid approach where the gateway forwards verified user info, and services only call auth service when they need to verify specific roles or permissions.
