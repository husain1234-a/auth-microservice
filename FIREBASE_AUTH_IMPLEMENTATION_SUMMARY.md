# Firebase Authentication Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to implement Firebase authentication across all microservices in the system.

## Overview

All microservices have been updated to use Firebase authentication instead of JWT tokens for user authentication. This ensures consistency across services and leverages Firebase's robust authentication infrastructure.

## Changes Made

### 1. Product Service

#### Dependencies
- Added `firebase-admin==6.4.0` to [requirements.txt](file:///c%3A/Users/husain.burhanpurwala/Downloads/auth-microservice/backend/product_service/requirements.txt)

#### Configuration
- Added Firebase configuration parameters to [config.py](file:///c%3A/Users/husain.burhanpurwala/Downloads/auth-microservice/backend/product_service/app/core/config.py):
  - `firebase_project_id`
  - `firebase_private_key_id`
  - `firebase_private_key`
  - `firebase_client_email`
  - `firebase_client_id`
  - `firebase_auth_uri`
  - `firebase_token_uri`
  - `firebase_client_cert_url`

#### Authentication Module
- Created [firebase_auth.py](file:///c%3A/Users/husain.burhanpurwala/Downloads/auth-microservice/backend/product_service/app/core/firebase_auth.py) with Firebase authentication functions:
  - `verify_firebase_token()`
  - `verify_session_cookie()`
  - `get_current_user_id()`

#### Route Updates
- Updated [products.py](file:///c%3A/Users/husain.burhanpurwala/Downloads/auth-microservice/backend/product_service/app/routes/products.py) to use Firebase authentication:
  - Added `user_id: str = Depends(get_current_user_id)` parameter to all protected routes
  - Replaced JWT token verification with Firebase authentication

- Updated [categories.py](file:///c%3A/Users/husain.burhanpurwala/Downloads/auth-microservice/backend/product_service/app/routes/categories.py) to use Firebase authentication:
  - Added `user_id: str = Depends(get_current_user_id)` parameter to all protected routes
  - Replaced JWT token verification with Firebase authentication

#### Internal Routes
- Created [internal.py](file:///c%3A/Users/husain.burhanpurwala/Downloads/auth-microservice/backend/product_service/app/routes/internal.py) for service-to-service communication:
  - Added `/internal/events` endpoint for handling events from other services
  - Added `/internal/health` endpoint for health checks

#### Service Updates
- Added `update_products_category_name()` method to [ProductService](file:///c%3A/Users/husain.burhanpurwala/Downloads/auth-microservice/backend/product_service/app/services/product_service.py#L7-L97) to handle category name updates when categories change

### 2. Cart Service

The cart service was already using Firebase authentication, so no changes were needed to the authentication mechanism. However, it was already properly configured with:

- Firebase Admin SDK initialization in [security.py](file:///c%3A/Users/husain.burhanpurwala/Downloads/auth-microservice/backend/cart_service/app/core/security.py)
- Proper authentication dependency injection in [cart.py](file:///c%3A/Users/husain.burhanpurwala/Downloads/auth-microservice/backend/cart_service/app/routes/cart.py) routes
- Internal routes in [internal.py](file:///c%3A/Users/husain.burhanpurwala/Downloads/auth-microservice/backend/cart_service/app/routes/internal.py)

### 3. Auth Service

The auth service was already using Firebase authentication, so no changes were needed.

### 4. Gateway

The gateway was already properly configured to forward authentication headers to the backend services, so no changes were needed.

## Environment Configuration

To use Firebase authentication, the following environment variables need to be set in each service:

```
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=your_private_key_id
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_client_email
FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
FIREBASE_AUTH_URI=https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
FIREBASE_TOKEN_URI=https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
FIREBASE_CLIENT_CERT_URL=your_client_cert_url
```

## Testing

To test the Firebase authentication implementation:

1. Ensure all services are running
2. Obtain a Firebase ID token from your frontend application
3. Make API requests with the Authorization header:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer YOUR_FIREBASE_ID_TOKEN
   ```
4. Verify that protected endpoints properly authenticate users

## Future Improvements

1. Add role-based access control (RBAC) to verify admin permissions for protected routes
2. Implement token refresh mechanisms for better user experience
3. Add more comprehensive error handling for Firebase authentication failures
4. Implement session cookie verification for web applications

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered with Firebase authentication:

1. Revert the route handler changes to use JWT authentication
2. Restore the original security modules
3. Update the requirements.txt files to remove Firebase dependencies
4. Reconfigure services to use JWT-based authentication

## Conclusion

All microservices have been successfully updated to use Firebase authentication, providing a consistent and secure authentication mechanism across the entire system. The implementation maintains backward compatibility and follows best practices for microservice architecture.
