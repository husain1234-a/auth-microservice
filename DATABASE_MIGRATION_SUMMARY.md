# Database Migration Summary for Microservice Architecture

This document summarizes the database changes made to transition from a monolithic database schema to a proper microservice architecture with isolated databases and no foreign key constraints.

## Overview

The migration removes all foreign key constraints between tables and adds denormalized fields to support the microservice architecture where each service has its own isolated database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Product Service Database Changes

#### Foreign Key Removal
- Removed foreign key constraint from `products.category_id` to `categories.id`

#### Denormalization
- Added `category_name` column to `products` table to store category names locally
- Populated existing `category_name` data from the categories table

#### Constraint Updates
- Removed NOT NULL constraint from `products.category_id` to allow products without categories

### 2. Cart Service Database Changes

#### Foreign Key Removal
- Removed foreign key constraint from `carts.user_id` to `users.uid`
- Removed foreign key constraint from `cart_items.cart_id` to `carts.id`
- Removed foreign key constraint from `cart_items.product_id` to `products.id`
- Removed foreign key constraint from `wishlists.user_id` to `users.uid`
- Removed foreign key constraint from `wishlist_items.wishlist_id` to `wishlists.id`
- Removed foreign key constraint from `wishlist_items.product_id` to `products.id`
- Removed foreign key constraint from `cart_promo_codes.cart_id` to `carts.id`
- Removed foreign key constraint from `cart_promo_codes.promo_code_id` to `promo_codes.id`

#### Denormalization
Added denormalized columns to `cart_items` table:
- `product_name` - Stores product name locally
- `product_price` - Stores product price locally
- `product_image_url` - Stores product image URL locally

Added denormalized columns to `wishlist_items` table:
- `product_name` - Stores product name locally
- `product_price` - Stores product price locally
- `product_image_url` - Stores product image URL locally

### 3. Migration Scripts

#### [remove_foreign_keys.sql](file:///c%3A/Users/husain.burhanpurwala/Downloads/auth-microservice/database/migrations/remove_foreign_keys.sql)
- Main migration script that removes all foreign key constraints
- Adds denormalized fields to support microservice architecture
- Updates existing data where possible

#### [cart_service_remove_foreign_keys.sql](file:///c%3A/Users/husain.burhanpurwala/Downloads/auth-microservice/database/migrations/cart_service_remove_foreign_keys.sql)
- Specific migration script for cart service database
- Removes all foreign key constraints from cart service tables
- Adds denormalized fields to cart_items and wishlist_items tables

#### [complete_microservice_migration.sql](file:///c%3A/Users/husain.burhanpurwala/Downloads/auth-microservice/database/migrations/complete_microservice_migration.sql)
- Comprehensive migration script that handles both product and cart services
- Removes all foreign key constraints
- Adds all necessary denormalized fields
- Grants necessary privileges

#### [updated_database_schema.sql](file:///c%3A/Users/husain.burhanpurwala/Downloads/auth-microservice/backend/cart_service/updated_database_schema.sql)
- Complete updated schema for cart service database
- No foreign key constraints
- All denormalized fields included
- Proper indexes and constraints

## Benefits of These Changes

### 1. Microservice Independence
- Each service can operate with its own isolated database
- No cross-service database dependencies
- Services can be deployed, scaled, and maintained independently

### 2. Improved Performance
- Eliminates cross-database joins which are expensive
- Local data access is faster than remote service calls
- Reduced network latency between services

### 3. Better Scalability
- Each service can use database optimization strategies specific to its needs
- Databases can be scaled independently based on service requirements
- Eliminates database-level bottlenecks

### 4. Enhanced Reliability
- Failure in one service doesn't affect database access in other services
- No cascading failures due to foreign key constraints
- Better fault isolation between services

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. Data Synchronization
- Services must implement event-driven architecture to keep denormalized data in sync
- Category name changes in product service must be propagated to cart service
- Product updates must be synchronized across services

### 2. Data Consistency
- Application-level consistency checks are needed since database-level constraints are removed
- Services must handle eventual consistency scenarios
- Error handling for synchronization failures

### 3. Testing
- Integration tests must verify data synchronization between services
- End-to-end tests should validate the complete flow
- Performance tests to ensure the new architecture meets requirements

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered with the new architecture:

1. Revert database changes using reverse migration scripts
2. Restore foreign key constraints
3. Remove denormalized columns
4. Reconfigure services to use the original monolithic database approach
5. Update application code to use joins instead of service calls

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Data Synchronization Monitoring
- Monitor event processing success rates
- Track synchronization latency between services
- Alert on synchronization failures

### 2. Performance Monitoring
- Monitor query performance in each service's database
- Track service response times
- Monitor database resource usage

### 3. Data Integrity Checks
- Regular checks to ensure denormalized data consistency
- Validation scripts to detect data discrepancies
- Automated correction mechanisms for common issues

## Conclusion

The database migration successfully transforms the architecture from a monolithic database with foreign key constraints to a proper microservice architecture with isolated databases and no cross-service dependencies. The changes support the principles of microservice design while maintaining data integrity through application-level synchronization and denormalization.
